Since Google ended support for the c100pa and I always wanted Debian Stable on this device I though I would give to the cause.

My goals are to have the built in hardware function in a ChromeOS-like way and have Debian freedom.
I'd like access to Android and x86 apps if I can but a lightweight admin machine is the main goal.

I want to thank the people who built devuan, prawn and shrimp for the veyron chromebooks. Keep the platform alive.
